## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/VincentMugondora/vincent_personal_portfolio.git
    cd my_portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (Frontend):**

    ```
    cd client  
    npm install 
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (Backend):**

    ```
    cd ../server  
    npm install 
    ```

4.  **Configuration:**

    *   **Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.**  Add the following environment variables (replace with your actual values):

        ```
        PORT=5000  
        MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_username>:<your_password>@<your_cluster_url>/<your_database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority  # Your MongoDB connection string
        EMAIL_USER=<your_email_address>  
        EMAIL_PASS=<your_email_password>  
        ```

        **Important:**  Never commit your `.env` file to your repository.  It contains sensitive information.  Make sure it's in your `.gitignore` file.

    *   **Frontend Configuration (if needed):**  If your frontend needs to connect to a specific backend URL, configure it accordingly (e.g., in a `config.js` file or environment variables).

5.  **Run the application:**

    *   **Start the backend server:**

        ```
        cd server

        npm start  
        ```

    *   **Start the frontend development server:**

        ```
        cd client
        npm run dev  
        ```

    *   The frontend will usually be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:5000` (or the ports you configured).
